    //dynamic typed languages are those in which type checking is done at run-type.

    //static type languages are JAVA, C++, C#, Objective C, etc
    //Dynamic type languages are javascript, python, swift etc

    //Javascript example - it only checks the error when you run it - not in real time
    //let myName = 43;

    //Java example - it gives you the error in real time - if you put the wrong value
    //String name = "Endri";
